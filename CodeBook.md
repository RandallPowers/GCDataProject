Feature Selection

Please refer to the README and features.txt files in the original dataset to learn more about the feature selection for this dataset. 

The output represents the mean of each variable for each activity and each subject. It is a table; each variable is represented by a column, and each activity/subject is represented by a row. The columns names are slightly modified from the "features.txt" input file content. The row names merge the activity and subject.
